<h1 id="changing-the-curriculum">Changing the curriculum</h1>
<p>This curriculum thrives because of the changes made by our many contributors. Read on for details on how to help every student that follows you.</p>
<h2 id="non-substantive-changes">Non-substantive changes</h2>
<p>If you have non-substantive updates to make to the curriculum, such as a course's URL having been moved, spelling/syntax errors, etc., please send a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/">pull request</a> to fix any mistakes that you have found.</p>
<h2 id="substantive-changes">Substantive changes</h2>
<p>If you have specific and substantive criticisms of the curriculum, i.e. problems related to the progression/content of courses it would be appropriate to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/">open an issue</a>. While it is acceptable to point out problems, all successful changes naturally require a plan for fixing the problem.</p>
<h2 id="other-ways-to-contribute">Other ways to contribute</h2>
<h3 id="responding-to-issues">Responding to Issues</h3>
<p>Issues require more than just users to suggest them. Issues require active community members to read and respond to proposals. Even adding simple <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/">emoji reactions</a> can help the community.</p>
